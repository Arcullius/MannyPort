# The Moundhalaverse 

## Overview
This is an interactive portfolio website featuring a 3D solar system interface where each planet represents a different section of my portfolio. 

## Current Work in Progress
I'm actively working on improving the user experience, particularly focusing on responsive design and zoom behavior. One of the current challenges I'm addressing is the modal scaling issue when users zoom out. This is similar to a problem I noticed on the Katapult website where popup menus were severely affected by browser zoom levels. I'm implementing solutions to maintain modal proportions and usability across different zoom levels.

## Technical Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript 
- Font Awesome for icons
- Google Fonts (Space Mono)

## Features
- Interactive 3D solar system interface
- Smooth animations and transitions (hopefully)
- Responsive design (mobile functionality still needs work)
- Dynamic typewriter effect
- Interactive planet orbits
- Modal-based content display
- Customizable settings panel
- Starry background effects

## Project Status
This is a work in progress, with ongoing improvements to:
- Modal scaling and responsiveness
- Animation performance
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility features

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for dynamic content
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- Additional interactive features

## Note
This project is being developed as part of my portfolio and is subject to ongoing improvements and refinements. The code represents my current skill set and approach to modern web development.
